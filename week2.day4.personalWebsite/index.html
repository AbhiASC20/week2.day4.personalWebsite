        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p2>My name is Abhi Pendyala.
            I am an incoming junior from Middletown, New Jersey, who is somewhat new to coding.
            I applied for the All Star Code internship and was accepted.
            I enjoy playing baseball because it is a very fun sport to play.
            I would like to become a sports analyst because it is a very fun job and I have lots of knowledge on sports.
